<div class="subnode">
Ahoy, matey!<br />
<br />
This is the <strong>Agora v{{version}}</strong>.<br />
<br />
This site is very much under construction, but feel free to look around: 
<ul>
	<li><a href="{{nodes_url}}">{{nodes}}</a> lists all non-journal nodes in this Agora; a node is the set of all subnodes with a given title, or otherwise about the same entity. Subnodes can come from a variety of sources; currently these are mostly notes as volunteered by users.</li>
	<li><a href="{{journals_url}}">{{journals}}</a> displays all journal entries (these are just nodes matching YYYY-MM-DD).</li>
	<li><a href="{{users_url}}">{{users}}</a> displays all users in this Agora. Click through to see their subnodes.</li>
	<li><a href="{{subnodes_url}}">{{latest}}</a> shows which subnodes were added or modified recently.</li>
	<li><a href="{{search_url}}">{{search}}</a> offers full text search over all subnodes (supports regexes).</li>
</ul>

The <a href="/wikilink">[[wikilink]]</a> is the heart of the Agora. <a href="/foo">/foo</a> will render every subnode that resolves to wikilink <a href="/foo">[[foo]]</a>. For example: <a href="/agora">[[Agora]]</a>.

<br /><br />
For more information, please visit the <a href="https://flancia.org/go/agora">Agora repository.</a> If you're interested in knowing what's coming, please refer to <a href="{{current_app.config['AGORA_URL']}/agora-plan">Agora plan</a>.
