# The Seven Priorities (2026)

*This document outlines the next seven major strategic arcs for the Agora, prioritized for impact and feasibility. Created on [[2026-01-20]].*

## 1. Hyper-Personalization (The "My" Agora)
*   **Goal**: Make the Agora feel like home for logged-in users.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **Roaming Prefs**: Sync `localStorage` settings to the user's garden (e.g., `@user/preferences.yaml`) via the Bullpen so they persist across devices.
    *   **Custom Dashboard**: Allow users to pin nodes or set a custom `start_node`.
    *   **Reading Queue**: functional "Mark as Read" / "Read Later" queue.

## 2. Semantic Search (Vector Embeddings)
*   **Goal**: Move beyond "Fuzzy" search to true "Meaning" search.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **Embeddings**: Generate vector embeddings for subnodes using `sentence-transformers` (local) or API.
    *   **Storage**: Use `sqlite-vec` (or FAISS) alongside `agora.db` for low-overhead vector search.
    *   **UI**: "Find similar thoughts" button.

## 3. Agentic Reading (Agora Skill V2)
*   **Goal**: Empower the agent to *truly* read and navigate the garden.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **Content Fetching**: Upgrade `scripts/agora.py` in the Skill repo to call `agora-server` APIs (like `/api/synthesize` or `/raw`) to get text content, not just URLs.
    *   **Recursive Research**: Enable the agent to follow links autonomously.
    *   **Constraint**: Keep the Skill repo code-light; relying on Server APIs.

## 4. Federation: System Boosts
*   **Goal**: Lightweight federation interaction before full identity.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **System Boost**: Allow the `@agora` system user to "Boost" (Announce) external posts or local subnodes to the Fediverse.
    *   **Benefit**: Increases visibility of content without needing per-user OAuth yet.

## 5. Narrative / Book View
*   **Goal**: Linearize the graph into a readable sequence.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **Playlists**: Curate an ordered list of nodes (`[[Chapter 1]]` -> `[[Chapter 2]]`).
    *   **Reader Mode**: Render these sequentially in a single view.
    *   **Nav**: "Previous/Next" links in wide layouts.

## 6. Presence ("Who is Here?")
*   **Goal**: Foster serendipity.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **Ephemeral State**: Lightweight Redis or SQLite-backed tracking of active users on a node.
    *   **Privacy**: Strictly opt-in and feature-flagged (`ENABLE_PRESENCE`).

## 7. Visual Graph 2.0
*   **Goal**: Make the graph useful for navigation, not just visualization.
*   **Tactics**:
    *   **Local Neighborhoods**: Default to "Root + 2 Hops" to reduce noise.
    *   **Filtering**: Toggle nodes by User or Tag.
    *   **Interactive**: Click-to-focus without full page reload.
