# Agora Development Plan: December 2025

This document outlines the key goals and progress for the Agora project in December 2025.

## 1. The Signup Story: Self-Service Onboarding

**Goal:** Allow users to join the Agora (add their digital garden) immediately via the web interface, removing the need for manual email processing.

### Status (as of 2025-12-13)
*   [x] **Bridge API (`agora-bridge`):** 
    *   Updated `POST /sources` to trigger an immediate synchronous `git clone`.
    *   This ensures the user's content is available on disk immediately after signup.
*   [x] **Server UI (`agora-server`):**
    *   Added a "Join / Add Garden" form to the Settings Overlay (`overlay.html`).
    *   Replaced the static "email us" instructions with an interactive form.
*   [x] **Client Logic:**
    *   Implemented form handling in `settings.ts` to submit data via `fetch`.
*   [x] **Server Proxy:**
    *   Created `POST /api/join` endpoint in `agora.py` to proxy requests to the Bridge API.

### Next Steps / Refinements
*   [ ] **Asynchronous Processing:** Move the `git clone` in Bridge to a background task (Celery/RQ) to prevent timeouts on large repos.
*   [ ] **Persistent Sync:** Ensure `pull.py` picks up the new source for future updates (currently requires Bridge restart).
*   [ ] **Identity Verification:** Implement a mechanism to verify ownership of the repo or identity (e.g., placing a file in the repo, or OAuth).
*   [ ] **Feedback Loop:** Show real-time progress of the clone operation in the UI.

## 2. Fediverse Integration: An Active Commons

**Goal:** Make `anagora.org` a full Fediverse participant. Users should be able to follow Agora users/nodes and receive updates when new content is published.

### Current State
*   `agora-server/app/federation.py` contains initial ActivityPub logic (WebFinger, Actor generation).
*   Basic `Inbox` and `Outbox` routes exist.

### Planned Work
*   [ ] **Follower Management:**
    *   Implement `Inbox` handling for `Follow` activities. (Partially done in `user_inbox`)
    *   Store followers in SQLite (`followers` table). (Done)
    *   Implement `Accept` activity response. (Done in `user_inbox` via `send_accept` thread)
*   [x] **Content Broadcasting (Outbox):**
    *   Implemented `federate_latest_loop` background thread.
    *   Polls `api.latest()` every 5 minutes.
    *   Broadcasts `Create` activities for new subnodes to followers.
    *   Tracks federation state in `federated_subnodes` table.
*   [x] **Star Federation:**
    *   When a user stars a node in Agora, publish a `Like` activity.
    *   Implemented `federate_create` to broadcast `Like` to `@agora` followers.

## 3. General Improvements
*   [x] **Executable Subnodes:**
    *   Fixed `subprocess` timeouts to prevent server hangs (moved to Python native timeout + `select` for output limiting).
    *   Implemented 256KB output limit to prevent OOM.
    *   Refactored execution logic into `util.py`.
*   [x] **UI Polish:**
    *   Refined Subnode headers (pushed vs normal).
    *   Cleaned up Footer layout (custard emoji placement, arrow prefixes).
    *   Improved CSS for user links.
