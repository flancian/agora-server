# âœ… Completed: Advanced UI/UX and Performance Tuning (September 2025)

This session focused on refining the user interface with more dynamic and intuitive controls, while also undertaking a significant performance optimization to reduce the application's initial load size.

-   **Unified Scroll Button**: Replaced the separate "Scroll to Top" and "Scroll to Bottom" buttons with a single, context-aware button in the navbar that intelligently flips its function and icon based on the user's scroll position.
-   **Theme Toggle Polish**: Fixed a CSS layout bug causing the theme toggle to overflow on mobile. A second, synchronized theme toggle was also added to the settings overlay for better accessibility.
-   **Animation Enhancements**:
    -   Added a subtle, non-disruptive "slide-in" animation for AI-generated content.
    -   Fixed a recurring bug where spinner animations would cause a flickering horizontal scrollbar by applying `overflow-x: hidden` to the relevant containers.
-   **Feature: MIDI Playback Easter Egg**:
    -   Integrated a lightweight MIDI player to provide a fun, auditory feedback element when the "Demo" mode is activated.
-   **Performance: Dynamic Module Loading**:
    -   Identified that the new audio libraries significantly increased the main JavaScript bundle size (~70 KB).
    -   Refactored the audio playback logic to use dynamic `import()` statements.
    -   Updated the `esbuild` configuration in `package.json` to support code splitting (`--splitting`, `--format=esm`, `--outdir`).
    -   Modified the main script tag in `base.html` to `type="module"` to enable the new loading strategy.
    -   **Result**: The main `index.js` bundle size was successfully reduced back to its original, smaller size. The audio libraries are now in separate "chunks" that are only downloaded by the browser on-demand when the user first clicks the demo button.

---

# âœ… Completed: UI Polish and Bug Fixes (September 2025)

This session focused on a series of rapid UI/UX refinements and bug fixes to improve the overall user experience.


-   **Theme Toggle**: Replaced the text-based theme toggle with a modern, animated switch in the main navbar for a more intuitive feel.
-   **Button Relocations**:
    -   Moved the "Demo" and "Annotate" buttons from the navbar and overlay to the main footer for better contextual grouping of actions.
    -   Moved the "Scroll to Top" and "Scroll to Bottom" buttons to the main navbar for easy access.
-   **"Pull/Fold" Button**: Enhanced the "Pull" button to act as a toggle. It now changes its icon and tooltip to "Fold" after expanding all sections, allowing users to collapse all sections with a second click.
-   **Wikilink Spacing Bug**: Diagnosed and fixed a CSS bug that was causing extra whitespace to appear next to wikilinks in node headers. The fix involved making a CSS rule more specific so it only applied on the `/nodes` page as originally intended.
-   **Search Provider Default**: Changed the default web search provider to Marginalia to provide a better user experience by avoiding cookie banners.
-   **Iframe URL Overlay**: Improved the positioning of the URL overlay on iframes to sit cleanly below the frame instead of overlapping it.
-   **Mobile Demo Popup**: Made the "Demo" popup responsive, ensuring it uses more screen width and does not exceed the screen height on mobile devices.
-   **"Browse As" Animation**: Addressed a visual bug where the "Browse As" subnode sorting would cause a distracting flicker. Replaced it with a subtle but clear "pulse" animation that highlights the subnode after it has been moved to the top.

# âœ… Completed: Background Cache Worker

**Status: Completed (September 2025)**
**Priority: High**

This task involved creating a separate, background worker process responsible for populating the SQLite graph cache. This decouples the expensive filesystem scan from the user-facing web application, eliminating "cold start" delays and ensuring a consistently fast user experience.

---

## âœ… Completed Architectural Plan

1.  **Self-Contained Worker (`worker.py`):**
    *   A new `worker.py` script was created in the root of the repository.
    *   The script is self-contained and can be run with `uv run python3 worker.py`.
    *   It correctly initializes a Flask app context to safely access the necessary Agora modules like `app.graph`.

2.  **Robust Caching Strategy (Blue-Green Table Swap):**
    *   The worker connects to the `agora.db` SQLite database.
    *   It performs the full filesystem scan to build the graph data in memory.
    *   Inside a single database transaction, it creates and populates temporary tables (`subnodes_new`, `links_new`).
    *   It then atomically swaps the new tables into place by dropping the old ones and renaming the new ones.
    *   This "table swap" method ensures the live web application experiences zero downtime.

3.  **No Disruption Guarantee:**
    *   This approach requires **no modifications** to the existing web application code. The Flask server remains completely unaware of the background worker.
    *   SQLite's WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode prevents read/write conflicts between the worker and the web server.

---

## Next Step: Scheduling the Worker

The `worker.py` script is now complete and can be run manually. The final step is to decide how to run it automatically. There are two viable options:

### Option A: External Scheduler (Cron/Systemd) - Recommended
This is the simplest and most robust approach.

*   **How it works:** A system utility like `cron` is configured to run the worker script on a regular schedule (e.g., every 5-10 minutes).
*   **Example Cron Job:**
    ```bash
    */5 * * * * cd /path/to/agora-server && /path/to/agora-server/.venv/bin/python3 worker.py >> /var/log/agora-worker.log 2>&1
    ```
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Decoupled:** The caching process is entirely separate from the web application's process.
    *   **Reliable:** `cron` is a time-tested, standard Unix utility.
    *   **No Code Changes:** Requires no further changes to the Python application.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Requires configuration on the server itself, outside of the application's repository.

### Option B: In-App Trigger (Flask Endpoint)
This approach allows triggering the worker via a web request.

*   **How it works:** Create a secure API endpoint (e.g., `/api/refresh-cache?secret=...`). When called, the Flask app would use Python's `multiprocessing` module to start the worker script in a non-blocking background process.
*   **Pros:**
    *   **On-Demand:** Allows for manually triggering a cache refresh without server access.
    *   **Self-Contained:** The trigger mechanism is managed within the application code.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **More Complex:** Requires adding a new endpoint and background process management logic to the Flask app.
    *   **Less Decoupled:** The lifecycle of the worker process is tied to the application process. If the app is restarted, the background worker might be orphaned.

# ðŸš€ High Priority: Implement On-Demand Hybrid SQLite Index

**Status: In Progress**
**Priority: High**

This document outlines the plan to implement a hybrid storage system where the filesystem remains the source of truth for content, and an SQLite database is used as a **high-performance, on-demand index** for metadata and computed byproducts. This approach will dramatically improve performance and scalability while preserving the core philosophy of the file-based Agora and eliminating the need for a separate indexing process.

---

## âœ… Completed Steps

-   **Feature Flag:** Added an `ENABLE_SQLITE` flag in `app/config.py` to control the entire feature. It is enabled by default in development environments.
-   **Robust DB Engine:** Re-architected `app/storage/sqlite_engine.py` to be fully thread-safe using Flask's application context (`g`). It now gracefully handles read-only filesystems and manages the database schema, including migrations.
-   **Optimized Schema:** Implemented a schema for `subnodes` and `links`, including a `source_node` column in the `links` table to allow for highly efficient backlink queries.
-   **On-Demand Indexing:** Implemented the core "write-through cache" logic in `app/graph.py`. Indexing now happens efficiently on-demand when a node is viewed, not during a slow initial scan.
-   **Performance Fix:** The `back_nodes` method in `app/graph.py` was refactored to query the SQLite index directly, resolving a major performance bottleneck and application hangs.
-   **Bug Squashing:** Debugged and fixed a series of follow-up issues, including `IntegrityError` from duplicate links, `ProgrammingError` from incorrect thread handling, and multiple `AttributeError` exceptions from mismatched function names.
-   **AI Generation Caching:** Implemented a caching layer for AI generations in SQLite, complete with configurable TTLs. This significantly improves performance for repeated AI queries.
-   **Backlink Bug Fix:** Diagnosed a critical bug where the on-demand SQLite indexing missed backlinks. Temporarily reverted to the file-based backlink method to ensure data correctness while a full indexing strategy is developed.

---

## Future Work & Priorities

The foundational work is complete, and the system is stable. The following tasks remain to fully realize the benefits of the SQLite index, prioritized as follows:

### 1. Immediate Priority: Cache High-Level Queries
**Goal:** Significantly improve performance for high-traffic list pages (`/users`, `/latest`, `/nodes`) with minimal impact on database size.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Extend the SQLite schema with a simple key-value table for caching query results.
    *   Modify expensive, file-based queries like `all_users()`, `latest()`, and `top()` to use this cache with a reasonable TTL.

### 2. Next Up: Implement Full-Text Search (FTS)
**Goal:** Provide near-instantaneous full-text search results.
**Status:** On hold pending evaluation of database growth.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Create a virtual FTS5 table in the schema.
    *   Update the on-demand indexing logic to populate this table with subnode content.
    *   Modify `search_subnodes` in `app/storage/api.py` to query the FTS index.

### 3. Longer-Term Goals

*   **Develop a Test Suite:**
    *   Create a formal test suite that can run against both the pure file engine and the hybrid SQLite engine to verify that they produce identical results.
*   **Create a Backfill Script (Optional):**
    *   Write a simple, one-off command-line script to pre-populate the index for existing production Agoras. While not strictly necessary due to the on-demand nature, this would "warm up" the cache for large sites.

---

## Core Principles (Unchanged)

1.  **Files are the Source of Truth:** All user-generated content (subnodes) will continue to live as plain text files on disk.
2.  **SQLite is a Just-in-Time Index:** The database acts as a "write-through cache."
3.  **The Application is the Indexer:** There is no separate indexer script.

---

## Database Schema

The Agora uses a single SQLite database (`instance/agora.db`) as a performance cache and for features that don't fit the file-based model. The schema is as follows:

-   **`subnodes`**: Caches metadata about individual subnodes (files).
    -   `path` (TEXT, PK): The unique identifier for the subnode, like `garden/user/entry.md`.
    -   `user` (TEXT): The user who owns the subnode.
    -   `node` (TEXT): The node URI this subnode contributes to, like `my_entry`.
    -   `mtime` (INTEGER): The last modification time of the file, used for cache invalidation.

-   **`links`**: An index of all `[[wikilinks]]` for fast backlink queries.
    -   `source_path` (TEXT): The subnode file where the link originates.
    -   `target_node` (TEXT): The node URI the link points to.
    -   `type` (TEXT): The type of link (e.g., 'wikilink').
    -   `source_node` (TEXT): The node URI that contains the source subnode.

-   **`ai_generations`**: Caches responses from AI providers.
    -   `prompt` (TEXT, PK): The full prompt sent to the AI.
    -   `provider` (TEXT, PK): The AI provider (e.g., 'gemini', 'mistral').
    -   `content` (TEXT): The generated content.
    -   `timestamp` (INTEGER): When the content was generated.

-   **`query_cache`**: A generic key-value cache for expensive, high-traffic queries (e.g., `/latest`, `/nodes`).
    -   `key` (TEXT, PK): The unique cache key (e.g., `latest_v2`).
    -   `value` (TEXT): The cached result (often as JSON).
    -   `timestamp` (INTEGER): When the result was cached.

---

# âœ… Completed: Caching and UI Polish (August 2025)

This session focused on implementing a robust caching layer for expensive, high-traffic queries and polishing several key UI/UX elements for better consistency and correctness.

-   **High-Performance Caching Layer:**
    -   Implemented a new caching layer in `app/storage/api.py` for the `latest()` and `top()` functions, dramatically speeding up the `/latest` and `/nodes` pages.
    -   Refined the caching strategy to store lightweight object data (dictionaries) instead of just URIs. This fixed a major performance bottleneck where cache hits were still slow due to N+1 file I/O operations during object reconstruction.
    -   Resolved a `TypeError` from stale cache formats by versioning the cache keys (e.g., `latest_v2`), ensuring a clean and robust transition.
    -   Fixed an `AttributeError` in the full graph visualization by intelligently bypassing the lightweight cache for that specific endpoint, ensuring the visualization code receives the full `Node` objects it requires while the main `/nodes` page remains fast.

-   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    -   **Theme-Aware Graphs:** Fixed a regression where both the per-node graph and the full Agora graph on the `/nodes` page would not update their colors after a theme change. The theme-toggle event listener now correctly re-renders any visible graphs.
    -   **Consistent Tab Styling:** Unified the CSS for the graph size tabs on the `/nodes` page to match the standard tabbed interface used for Web, AI, and Wikimedia sections, improving UI consistency.
    -   **Improved `/latest` View:** Added the modification date as a wikilink to each entry on the `/latest` page, making it more informative and better integrated.

---

# âœ… Completed: UI/UX Refinements (August 2025)

-   **"Browse As" Feature**: Completed the "browse as" feature in the settings overlay. The user's preference is saved to `localStorage` and used to dynamically update the `src` of the edit iframe in `edit.html`, pointing it to the correct user's editing environment.
-   **Graph Visualization Z-Index Fix**: Corrected a CSS stacking issue where the "Toggle Labels" button on graphs would render on top of the settings overlay and the main navigation bar. Removed the unnecessary `z-index` from the button's style in `main.css`.
-   **Journals View Refactoring**: Overhauled the `/journals` page to improve usability and visual consistency.
    -   **Consistent Rendering**: Modified the `journals.html` template to use the standard `subnode.html` partial, ensuring journal entries look identical to subnodes in the main node view.
    -   **Grouping by Date**: Updated the `journals` view function in `app/agora.py` to group entries by date, and updated the template to render these groups under clear date headings.
    -   **Bug Fix**: Resolved an `AttributeError` by correcting the data structure passed from the view to the template.

---

# âœ… Completed: Unify CSS Stylesheets and Implement Theming

**Status: COMPLETED (August 2025)**
**Priority: High**

This task involved refactoring the current dual-stylesheet (light/dark) system into a modern, single-stylesheet architecture using CSS Custom Properties (Variables). This has improved performance, simplified maintenance, and provided a better user experience.

---

## âœ… Completed Steps

-   **Consolidated Stylesheets:** Merged `screen-dark.css` and `screen-light.css` into a single `app/static/css/main.css`.
-   **Defined CSS Palettes:** Created themeable color palettes using CSS variables for both dark (default) and light themes under a `[data-theme="light"]` selector.
-   **Refactored CSS:** Replaced hardcoded color values throughout the stylesheet with the new CSS variables.
-   **Updated JavaScript:** Modified the theme-switcher in `app/js-src/main.ts` to toggle the `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` element, resulting in instant, FOUC-less theme changes.
-   **Updated Templates:** Modified `app/templates/base.html` to link to the single new stylesheet.
-   **Cleanup:** Deleted the old, redundant CSS files.

---

## Benefits Achieved

1.  **Instant Theme Switching:** No network request is needed, so theme changes are immediate and seamless.
2.  **Simplified Maintenance:** All styles and color palettes are in one file, eliminating duplicated code and making updates much easier.
3.  **Cleaner Code:** The JavaScript is simpler, and the backend logic for versioning is streamlined.
4.  **Future-Proof:** This is the modern, standard way to handle theming.

# âœ… Completed: Graph Architecture Refactoring 

**Status: COMPLETED (August 2025)**

This document outlines the completed refactoring to improve the Agora's architecture by centralizing graph operations into `app/graph.py`.

## âœ… Completed Architecture Changes

### New Clean Separation of Concerns

**Before:** `app/storage/file_engine.py` handled both data access AND graph logic (~1500 lines)

**After:** Clean separation across three files:

- **`app/graph.py` (NEW - Core Graph Module):** Contains `Graph`, `Node`, `Subnode`, `User` classes with comprehensive type hints. This is now the central API for all graph operations.

- **`app/visualization.py` (RENAMED from `app/storage/graph.py`):** Handles visual graph representation (RDF, Turtle, JSON for D3.js force graphs).

- **`app/storage/file_engine.py` (STRIPPED DOWN):** Now only handles file I/O operations (~247 lines). No knowledge of Graph/Node concepts.

### âœ… Completed Tasks

**Phase 1: Architecture Restructure** 
- âœ… **Created `app/graph.py`:** Moved all core classes (`Graph`, `Node`, `Subnode`, `User`) with global `G` instance
- âœ… **Renamed `app/storage/graph.py` â†’ `app/visualization.py`:** Clear separation of graph logic vs. visualization
- âœ… **Stripped `app/storage/file_engine.py`:** Down to pure file operations (1500â†’247 lines)
- âœ… **Updated `app/storage/api.py`:** Now imports core classes from `app/graph`
- âœ… **Updated all imports:** `app/agora.py` and other files now reference correct modules

**Phase 2: Type Safety & Quality**
- âœ… **Added comprehensive type hints:** All key methods properly typed
  - `forward_links() -> List[str]` (wikilink strings)  
  - `forward_nodes() -> List[Node]` (actual Node objects)
  - `back_links() -> List[str]`, `back_nodes() -> List[Node]`
  - `subnodes() -> List[Subnode]`, `node(uri: str) -> Node`
  - All constructors and build functions properly typed
- âœ… **Backwards compatibility:** All existing imports still work through storage layer

**Phase 3: Bug Fixes & Integration**
- âœ… **Fixed graph visualization navigation:** Corrected TypeScript template strings in `main.ts`
- âœ… **Compiled TypeScript:** Fixed click handlers with `npm run build`
- âœ… **Import path corrections:** Fixed relative imports after moving `visualization.py`
- âœ… **Verified functionality:** Agora loads and graph visualization works correctly

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Cleaner Architecture**: Graph logic separated from file I/O
2. **Better Maintainability**: Core classes in dedicated `app/graph.py` 
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type hints prevent runtime errors
4. **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing code continues to work
5. **Future-Ready**: Foundation for GraphQL APIs, better testing, etc.

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimization Plan

**Phase 1 (Quick Wins - âœ… COMPLETED):**
- âœ… **Add HTTP caching headers to expensive endpoints** (`/graph/json/*`, `/graph/turtle/*`)
  - Individual nodes: 30 min - 1 hour cache
  - Full graph data: 2 hours cache (very expensive)
  - Added `Vary: Accept-Encoding` for compression compatibility
- âœ… **Enable gzip compression for large responses**
  - Added `flask-compress` dependency with uv
  - Automatic compression for JSON/text responses >500 bytes
  - Significant bandwidth savings for graph visualization data
- âœ… **Implement content-based TTL strategy**
  - `graph_json`: 7200s (2h) - expensive visualization data
  - `node_data`: 1800s (30m) - moderate node operations  
  - `subnodes`: 900s (15m) - file content changes
  - `search`: 300s (5m) - frequently changing results
  - Backwards compatible with existing random TTL

**Phase 2 (Medium-term):**
- [ ] Set up Redis cache layer for shared caching across instances
- [ ] Pre-compute and cache expensive graph operations
- [ ] Add ETag support for conditional requests

**Phase 3 (Long-term):**
- [ ] Background task processing for heavy operations
- [ ] Database query optimizations
- [ ] CDN integration for static graph data

## Next Steps (Future Work)

Additional improvements beyond performance:

- [ ] **Create comprehensive test suite** for `app/graph.py` classes
- [ ] **Template optimization**: Update Jinja2 templates to use Node objects vs strings where beneficial  
- [ ] **Remove deprecated methods**: Once call sites are updated, consider removing `forward_links` in favor of `forward_nodes`
- [ ] **GraphQL API**: The new structure makes this much easier to implement

# ðŸ’¡ Future Feature Idea: Agora Notes / Seedlings

**(Proposed by Gemini)**

**Status: Idea / To Be Prioritized**
**Priority: Low**

This document outlines a proposal for a new feature that would add a native, low-friction way for users to leave short, informal notes on any node in the Agora. This would bridge the gap between passive consumption and the higher-commitment act of creating a full subnode in a personal digital garden.

---

## Concept: "Seedlings"

The core idea is to add a "scratchpad" or "notes" section to every node page. This would allow any user (identified by their "Browse As" name) to contribute fleeting thoughts, questions, or links directly to the node, fostering a more dynamic and conversational layer on top of the curated knowledge base.

These contributions are called "Seedlings" because they represent nascent ideas that could, with time and cultivation, grow into more complete thoughts or even full subnodes.

## User Experience

-   **Display**: A new section, perhaps titled "ðŸŒ± Seedlings," would appear on each node page, listing all notes for that node. Each note would show its content, the author, and a timestamp.
-   **Contribution**: A simple `<textarea>` and a "Leave a Note" button would allow for quick, asynchronous submission of new notes without a page reload.
-   **Integration**: Notes would be rendered using the Agora's standard processor, meaning any `[[wikilinks]]` within them would be fully functional and integrated into the graph.

## Proposed Technical Implementation

This feature is designed to integrate cleanly with the existing architecture.

1.  **Database (SQLite):**
    *   A new table, `agora_notes`, would be added to `agora.db`.
    *   **Schema**: `id`, `node_uri`, `author`, `content`, `timestamp`.

2.  **Backend API (`app/agora.py`):**
    *   `GET /api/notes/<path:node_uri>`: Fetches all notes for a given node as JSON.
    *   `POST /api/notes/add`: Accepts a JSON payload (`node_uri`, `author`, `content`) and creates a new note in the database.

3.  **Frontend Logic (`app/js-src/main.ts`):**
    *   On node page load, a new function would call the `GET` endpoint to fetch and render existing notes.
    *   An event listener on the "Leave a Note" button would handle the `POST` request and dynamically add the new note to the page on success.

## Benefits

-   **Universality**: Every node would have a space for spontaneous collaboration.
-   **Lower Barrier to Entry**: Encourages participation from users who may not maintain a full digital garden.
-   **Searchability**: As a native feature, these notes could be integrated into the Agora's search index.
-   **Performance**: A lightweight API is more efficient than loading a full external application in an iframe for this purpose.

*This analysis was conducted in August 2025. The codebase shows signs of mature, thoughtful development with room for systematic improvement.*

# Codebase Analysis & Observations

*Added by Claude - comprehensive analysis for future developers*

## Project Overview

The **Agora Server** is a Flask-based web application that powers a distributed knowledge graph called an "Agora". It aggregates digital gardens and information sources, making them searchable and interlinked through a wiki-like interface with [[wikilinks]].

### Key Concepts
- **Nodes**: Core knowledge entities identified by wikilinks (e.g., [[foo]])
- **Subnodes**: Individual files/sources that contribute content to a node
- **Users/Gardens**: Contributors who maintain digital gardens
- **Graph**: The interconnected network of all nodes and their relationships

## Current Architecture

### High-Level Structure
```
app/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py          # Flask app factory
â”œâ”€â”€ agora.py            # Main views and routing (primary controller)
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py           # Environment-specific configurations
â”œâ”€â”€ storage/            # Data layer abstraction
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api.py          # Storage engine adapter (file vs SQLite)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ file_engine.py  # File-based storage (primary implementation)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sqlite_engine.py # Alternative SQLite storage (incomplete)
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/          # Jinja2 templates (extensive set)
â”œâ”€â”€ render.py           # Markdown/content rendering with wikilink parsing
â”œâ”€â”€ util.py             # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ exec/              # Executable node system (security-sensitive)
â””â”€â”€ static/            # CSS, JS, images
```

## Key Architectural Patterns

### 1. Storage Engine Abstraction
- `app/storage/api.py` provides a clean adapter pattern
- Supports swapping between file-based and SQLite storage via `STORAGE_ENGINE` env var
- File engine is mature; SQLite engine needs completion

### 2. Content Processing Pipeline
1. **File Discovery**: Glob patterns find markdown files in configured directories
2. **Parsing**: Markdown rendered with custom wikilink extension
3. **Graph Building**: Links extracted and bidirectional relationships established
4. **Caching**: TTL caching at multiple levels to handle I/O-heavy operations

### 3. Template-Heavy Architecture
- 30+ Jinja2 templates suggest rich, diverse UI functionality
- Templates handle: nodes, search, users, graphs, feeds, AI integration, etc.

## Strengths

### âœ… Clean Separation of Concerns
- Well-defined layers: routing â†’ storage â†’ rendering â†’ templates
- Storage abstraction allows for different backends

### âœ… Rich Feature Set
- Multi-format support (Markdown, Org-mode)
- Feed generation (RSS/Atom)
- Search capabilities (full-text, regex)
- AI integration (Mistral API)
- User gardens and collaborative features
- Graph visualization
- Executable nodes (with security controls)

### âœ… Flexible Configuration
- Environment-specific configs (Dev/Prod/Alpha)
- Feature flags for experiments
- YAML-based configuration for Agora-specific settings

### âœ… Performance Considerations
- TTL caching throughout (`@cachetools.func.ttl_cache`)
- Randomized cache expiry prevents thundering herd

## Areas for Improvement

### ðŸ”§ Code Quality & Maintainability

1. **Type Hints**: Inconsistent typing throughout codebase
   - The current PLAN.md addresses Node class typing - extend this project-wide

2. **Documentation**: Limited inline documentation
   - Consider adding docstrings to complex functions
   - API documentation would help contributors

3. **File Size**: `app/storage/file_engine.py` is likely large and complex
   - The planned refactoring to separate concerns is excellent

### ðŸ”§ Testing Infrastructure

4. **Test Coverage**: Only saw mention of `app/test_node.py` in PLAN
   - No evidence of comprehensive test suite
   - **Recommendation**: Establish pytest framework with fixtures
   - Add integration tests for template rendering
   - Test different storage engines

### ðŸ”§ Dependency Management

5. **Dependencies**: Heavy dependency list in `pyproject.toml`
   - 40+ direct dependencies
   - **Recommendation**: Audit for unused packages
   - Consider lighter alternatives where possible

### ðŸ”§ Security & Performance

6. **Security**: Executable nodes feature needs careful audit
   - Currently controlled by `ENABLE_EXECUTABLE_NODES` flag
   - Consider sandboxing or containerization

7. **Caching Strategy**: Multiple caching layers but may need refinement
   - Random TTL (120-240s) is interesting but might benefit from profiling
   - Consider Redis for multi-instance deployments

### ðŸ”§ Code Organization

8. **Template Organization**: 30+ templates in single directory
   - Consider subdirectories by feature area
   - Template inheritance could be optimized

9. **Static Asset Management**: Manual JavaScript management
   - Consider modern build tools (already has package.json)
   - TypeScript compilation seems ad-hoc

## Suggested Improvements (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Complete the Node class refactoring** (already planned in PLAN.md)
2. **Add comprehensive test suite** with pytest
3. **Complete SQLite storage engine** for better scalability
4. **Audit and optimize dependencies**

### Medium Priority
5. **Add project-wide type hints** and configure mypy
6. **Improve documentation** with docstrings and API docs
7. **Reorganize templates** into logical subdirectories
8. **Modernize JavaScript build process**

### Low Priority (Polish)
9. **Performance profiling** and cache optimization
10. **Security audit** of executable nodes
11. **Template inheritance optimization**
12. **Static analysis tools** (black, flake8, etc.)

## Development Workflow Notes

### Current Setup
- UV for Python dependencies
- npm for JavaScript (with TypeScript sources)
- Multiple run scripts for different environments
- Docker support available

### Recommendations for New Contributors
1. Start with the Node refactoring task (well-documented)
2. Use `./run-dev.sh` for development, or `./run-dev.sh Local` for example if you want to run `tar.agor.ai` in particular :)
3. Check `app/config.py` for feature flags before implementing ideally. **Note**: The production Agora `anagora.org` currently runs using the `AlphaConfig`, not `ProductionConfig`.
4. Try to understand how the node is assembled and all else should follow :) Have fun!

### Critical Files to Understand
- `app/graph.py` - **Core graph classes**: `Graph`, `Node`, `Subnode`, `User` with type hints
- `app/agora.py:42` - Global graph instance (`G = api.Graph()`)
- `app/visualization.py` - Graph visualization (RDF, Turtle, JSON for D3.js)
- `app/storage/file_engine.py` - Pure file I/O operations (stripped down to ~247 lines)
- `app/render.py:37` - Wikilink parsing and content rendering
- `app/config.py:68` - User ranking system

## Future Architecture Considerations

1. **Microservices**: Current monolith could be split into:
   - Content ingestion service
   - Graph API service  
   - Web interface service

2. **GraphQL API**: Rich graph structure would benefit from GraphQL

3. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket support for collaborative editing

4. **Plugin System**: Architecture supports it, could formalize extension points

# Session Summary (Gemini, 2025-08-16)

*This section documents a collaborative development session focused on dependency modernization, new feature integration, and UI/UX refinements.*

## Project Understanding & Key Learnings

- **Primary Goal**: The Agora is a Flask-based server for a distributed knowledge graph, designed to connect "digital gardens" into a collaborative, problem-solving commons.
- **Tech Stack**: The project uses `uv` for Python dependencies, `npm` for frontend packages, Jinja2 for templating, and TypeScript (compiled to JS with `esbuild`) for client-side interactivity.
- **Architecture**: A key pattern is the **filesystem-as-database**, where Markdown/text files in user gardens are parsed to build the graph. Configuration is king, with `app/config.py` acting as the source of truth for feature flags, API keys, and environment URLs.
- **Development Workflow**:
    1.  Install dependencies: `uv sync` (Python) and `npm install` (JS).
    2.  Run the dev server: `./run-dev.sh`.
    3.  **Crucially**: After changing TypeScript files in `app/js-src/`, they must be re-compiled to JavaScript using `npm run build`.
    4.  Production deployment is managed by a `systemd` service (`agora-server.service`) which executes `run-prod.sh`. A typical deploy involves `git pull`, `uv sync`, and `systemctl --user restart agora-server`.

## Summary of Changes Implemented

### 1. Dependency Modernization: Poetry to `uv`
- **Goal**: Remove all traces of the old `poetry` dependency manager to align with the project's move to `uv`.
- **Actions**:
    - Deleted `poetry.lock`.
    - Updated `README.md` with `uv` installation and usage instructions.
    - Modified `entrypoint.sh` and `Dockerfile` to use `uv sync` instead of `poetry install`.
    - Confirmed `pyproject.toml` was already in a compatible format.

### 2. Feature: Gemini AI Integration
- **Goal**: Add Google's Gemini as a second AI provider alongside the existing Mistral implementation, with a clean user interface.
- **Actions**:
    - **Backend**:
        - Added `GEMINI_API_KEY` handling in `app/config.py`.
        - Added the `google-generativeai` library to `pyproject.toml` and installed it.
        - Implemented a `gemini_complete` function in `app/providers.py`.
        - Created a new, separate API endpoint `/api/gemini_complete/<prompt>` in `app/agora.py`.
    - **Frontend**:
        - Refactored `app/templates/genai.html` to use a **tabbed interface** for selecting between Mistral and Gemini.
        - Updated `app/js-src/main.ts` to handle tab clicks, fetch from the correct API endpoint, and load the content into a shared div.
        - Ensured the default provider (Mistral) loads automatically when the section is first expanded.
        - Re-added external links for ChatGPT and Claude with a "â¬ˆ" symbol to distinguish them.

### 3. UI/UX Refinements
- **"Agora Toggle" Link**: Modified the "â¸Ž" link in the footer to be a true toggle. It now reads from `config.py` to link from the dev environment to production and vice-versa, preserving the user's context.
- **CSS Style Distinction**:
    - Refactored the styling for `.intro` and `.info-box` divs to create a clearer visual hierarchy for different types of messages.
    - Updated `app/templates/sync.html` to use the new `.intro` class for search-related feedback.
    - Adjusted styles in both `screen-dark.css` and `screen-light.css`, ensuring the logic was correct for both themes and respected the CSS import order.

## Crumbs for the Future

- **Configuration is the Source of Truth**: When adding features that depend on environment (e.g., dev vs. prod URLs), always add variables to `app/config.py` rather than hardcoding them or relying on the `request` object.
- **Frontend Build Step is Essential**: Remember to run `npm run build` after any changes to `.ts` files in `app/js-src/`.
- **Asynchronous Loading**: Much of the page is loaded asynchronously. The core logic for this is in `app/js-src/main.ts`. New interactive elements should be integrated there.
- **Styling**: The Agora uses a dual-theme system. Changes to CSS should be tested in both light (`screen-light.css`) and dark (`screen-light.css`) modes. Note that `screen-light.css` imports and overrides the dark theme.

# Session Summary (Gemini, 2025-08-26)

*This section documents a collaborative development session focused on bug fixing and significant UI/UX enhancements, particularly for the settings and Hypothesis integration.*

## Key Learnings & Codebase Insights

- **CSS Layout & Positioning**: The session highlighted the complexities of CSS positioning, especially for overlays on a centered, responsive layout.
    - **Initial Problem**: The settings overlay (`.overlay`) was not aligned with the main content on wide screens and was partially visible when it should have been hidden.
    - **Evolution of the Solution**:
        1.  Initial attempts with JavaScript-based positioning caused flickering and were overly complex.
        2.  Attempts with pure CSS using `calc()` and `vw` units proved brittle and led to minor misalignments.
        3.  **Final, Robust Solution**: The key was to make the main `.content` div a positioning context (`position: relative`) and also a *clipping context* (`overflow-x: hidden`). The overlay was then placed inside `.content` and animated using the `left` property (`left: -100%` to `left: 0`). This CSS-only approach is efficient, eliminates flickering, and guarantees perfect alignment and hiding.
- **Hypothesis Integration**:
    - The integration is controlled by a feature flag (`ENABLE_HYPOTHESIS`) in `app/config.py`.
    - The Hypothesis client's UI can be injected into a specific container using the `externalContainerSelector` configuration in `app/templates/base.html`. This is essential for custom positioning and styling.
    - **Draggable UI**: A draggable panel was implemented from scratch for the Hypothesis client. The key components were:
        - A dedicated drag handle (`#hypothesis-drag-handle`).
        - TypeScript logic in `main.ts` to track mouse events (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`) and update the container's position using `transform: translate3d()`.
        - The final panel position is saved to `localStorage` and restored on page load, providing a persistent user experience.
- **API Interaction (Wikipedia)**:
    - Debugged and fixed the Wikipedia integration in `app/exec/wp.py`.
    - **Key Fix**: The Wikipedia API requires a `User-Agent` header for all requests. Failing to provide one results in a `403 Forbidden` error. Adding a proper header resolved the issue.
    - Error handling was also improved to be more specific, distinguishing between network errors, JSON parsing errors, and cases where no search results were found.

## Summary of Changes Implemented

1.  **Wikipedia Integration (`wp.py`)**:
    - Added a `User-Agent` header to all `requests.get()` calls to the Wikipedia API to fix ``403 Forbidden` errors.
    - Implemented more specific error handling to provide clearer feedback to the user.

2.  **Hypothesis Annotation Client**:
    - Re-enabled the client via a new `ENABLE_HYPOTHESIS` feature flag.
    - Implemented a "Show hypothes.is" checkbox in the settings overlay to toggle its visibility. The state is saved to `localStorage`.
    - Created a custom, **draggable panel** for the Hypothesis client to live in, complete with a title bar, drag handle, and close button.
    - The panel's position is now saved to `localStorage` and restored on subsequent page loads.

3.  **Settings Overlay (Burger Menu)**:
    - Undertook a significant refactoring of the overlay's CSS to fix a persistent alignment and visibility bug.
    - The final solution places the overlay inside the main `.content` div, which acts as a clipping and positioning context. This ensures the overlay is always perfectly aligned with the main content and is completely hidden off-screen when inactive.
    - The slide-in and slide-out animations were preserved and made more reliable.

4.  **Minor UI Tweaks**:
    - Added an icon to the "Source" button in the footer.
    - Removed separators between footer buttons for a cleaner look.

# Session Summary (Gemini, 2025-08-26)

*This section documents a collaborative development session focused on log cleanup and a major refactoring of the UI for embedded third-party content.*

## Key Learnings & Codebase Insights

- **UI Consistency is Key**: The session's main theme was refactoring disparate UI elements (`Wikipedia`, `Wiktionary`, `AI Generations`, `Web Search`) into a single, consistent, and reusable pattern.
- **New UI Pattern**: A new standard has been established for embedding external content:
    - A `<details>` element is used as the main container, allowing the section to be expanded and collapsed.
    - The `<summary>` contains a header and a series of tabs.
    - Each tab is a `<span>` with a `data-provider` attribute. This keeps the clickable tab separate from any external links.
    - The content for each provider is loaded on-demand into a corresponding `<div class="...-embed" data-provider="...">`.
- **Client-Side Logic**: The logic for this new pattern is handled in two places:
    1.  **`app/templates/sync.html`**: Contains the JavaScript to fetch the initial HTML for the Wikimedia section and attach the tab-switching event listeners.
    2.  **`app/js-src/main.ts`**: Contains the logic for the AI Generations and Web Search sections. This includes the `toggle` event listener to auto-load content when a section is expanded.
- **Jinja2 Templating**: The session highlighted the importance of careful conditional logic in Jinja2 templates. A mismatched `{% if %}` block caused a `TemplateSyntaxError` that was quickly resolved.

## Summary of Changes Implemented

### 1. Log Cleanup and Performance Timing
- **Reduced Verbosity**: Removed several redundant and noisy log messages from the application, particularly the "Initiating request" and "Assembled node" messages.
- **Streamlined Output**: Consolidated multi-line log entries for node assembly into single, more informative lines.
- **Performance Metrics**: Added detailed timing information to the logs for node assembly, including timings for each major stage of the process. This will be invaluable for future performance tuning.

### 2. Wikimedia Tabbed Interface
- **New UI**: Created a new tabbed interface for the Wikimedia section, allowing users to switch between Wikipedia and Wiktionary results.
- **Consistent Styling**: The new interface was styled to match the existing "AI Generations" section, creating a more unified look and feel.
- **User Settings**: The section now respects the "Embed Wikimedia" setting in the user's preferences, showing the summary by default and only embedding the content if the setting is enabled.
- **Dynamic Labels**: The tabs now dynamically display the title of the Wikipedia article or Wiktionary entry.
- **Graceful Fallback**: If no results are found for either Wikipedia or Wiktionary, a clear message is displayed instead of an empty section.

### 3. AI Generations UI Refactoring
- **Goal**: To make the "AI Generations" section consistent with the new Wikimedia tabbed interface.
- **Actions**:
    - Refactored `app/templates/genai.html` to use the new tabbed structure.
    - Updated `app/js-src/main.ts` to handle the new tab logic, including auto-pulling content when the section is expanded and displaying a loading spinner.
    - Fixed a bug where the spinner animation was causing a flickering horizontal scrollbar by adding `overflow-x: hidden` to the content container.

### 4. Web Results UI Refactoring
- **Goal**: To apply the same consistent tabbed interface to the "Web Results" section.
- **Actions**:
    - Overhauled `app/templates/web.html` to transform the list of links into a fully functional tabbed interface.
    - Each search provider is now a tab that loads an embedded `iframe` on demand.
    - Each tab is paired with a "â¬ˆ" link to allow users to easily open the search results in a new browser tab.
    - All providers, including Google Maps, are now integrated into the tab system for a consistent user experience.
- **Embeddability Check**:
    - Created a new API endpoint (`/api/check_embeddable`) that checks if a URL can be embedded in an iframe.
    - The frontend now calls this endpoint before attempting to embed content, showing a user-friendly message if embedding is blocked.

# Session Summary (Gemini, 2025-08-28)

*This section documents a collaborative development session that focused on enabling and refining the new SQLite and CSS theming features, culminating in a successful production deployment.*

## Key Learnings & Codebase Insights

-   **Production Environment**: A key operational detail was clarified: the production Agora `anagora.org` runs using the `AlphaConfig` from `app/config.py`, not the `ProductionConfig`. This is critical information for any future deployments.
-   **SQLite Concurrency**: The use of `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;` in `app/storage/sqlite_engine.py` was confirmed to be the correct approach for handling concurrent read/write access from multiple `uwsgi` workers in production. This makes the SQLite backend safe for this deployment model.
-   **Iterative Debugging**: A significant portion of the session was dedicated to a tight loop of implementing features, identifying UI/UX bugs, and fixing them. This included:
    -   Fixing a recurring "flickering scrollbar" issue on spinner animations by applying `overflow-x: hidden` to the parent containers.
    -   Refining the layout of the "context" section to be a more usable side-by-side view.
    -   Debugging a theme-related JavaScript crash in the graph rendering logic caused by `undefined` color values, and making the code more robust.
-   **Code Readability**: A "teachable moment" occurred when a large, obfuscated third-party utility function (`pSBC`) was introduced for color manipulation. It was subsequently replaced with a smaller, clearer, and well-documented internal function (`darkenColor`), prioritizing long-term maintainability over a "clever" but opaque solution.

## Summary of Changes Implemented

1.  **SQLite AI Generation Caching**:
    -   Successfully enabled the SQLite backend for caching AI provider (Mistral, Gemini) responses.
    -   Added a `SQLITE_CACHE_TTL` configuration dictionary to `app/config.py` to control cache duration on a per-type basis.
    -   Extended the database schema with an `ai_generations` table.
    -   Refactored the AI provider logic into `app/providers.py`, unified under a caching decorator.

2.  **Major CSS and Theming Refactor**:
    -   **Completed** the unification of `screen-dark.css` and `screen-light.css` into a single `main.css`.
    -   Implemented a modern, flicker-free theming system using CSS Custom Properties (variables) and a `data-theme` attribute on the `<html>` tag.
    -   Refactored all relevant templates and JavaScript to support the new system.

3.  **Theme-Aware Graph Visualization**:
    -   The force-directed graph in the "context" section was refactored to be fully theme-aware.
    -   It now dynamically adjusts its colors (background, links, node labels) when the user toggles the theme, without requiring a page reload.
    -   Node label colors are now preserved and automatically darkened on the light theme to ensure readability.

4.  **Critical Backlink Bug Fix**:
    -   Diagnosed and fixed a critical issue where the on-demand SQLite indexing was failing to show all backlinks for a node.
    -   To ensure data correctness, the optimized SQLite query for backlinks was temporarily disabled in `app/graph.py`, reverting to the slower but reliable file-based method. A `TODO` was left to implement a full indexing strategy in the future.

5.  **UI/UX Polish**:
    -   Adjusted the spacing in the main navbar for better readability.
    -   Fine-tuned the dark mode colors for buttons and info boxes for better aesthetics and contrast, achieving a "flan-like" look.
    -   Fixed numerous layout and visibility bugs related to the new theming and graph rendering.
