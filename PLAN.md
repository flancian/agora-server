# ðŸŽµ Future Work

## Musical Side Quests

**Goal:** Enrich the Agora's atmosphere and provide tools for musical exploration.
**Priority: Low**

-   **Tasks:**
    -   **Ambient Music Toggle (In Progress):**
        -   Add a `ðŸŽµ` toggle to the main action bar.
        -   When enabled, it will show a small, draggable mini-player that plays a looping, ambient MIDI track.
        -   The feature will use dynamic imports to load audio libraries on-demand, preserving initial page load speed.
        -   The player's state (on/off) and position will be saved to `localStorage`.
    -   **A/V Provider Tab (Next Up):**
        -   Create a new "Media" section alongside the existing AI, Web, and Wikimedia sections.
        -   Implement a tab for `chiptune.app`, which will be loaded on-demand into an iframe.
        -   The implementation will use the existing embeddability check to provide a graceful fallback if the site cannot be embedded.

## Fediverse Integration (ActivityPub)

**Goal:** Integrate the Agora with the Fediverse, allowing Agora users to be followed and their contributions to appear as posts on platforms like Mastodon.
**Priority: Medium**

-   **Tasks:**
    -   **Step 1: Flesh out the Actor Profile**
        -   Update the `/u/<user>` endpoint to dynamically pull user data from the Agora.
        -   Populate fields like `name`, `preferredUsername`, and `summary` (perhaps from a `[[@user/bio]]` node).
        -   Ensure the `url` field points to the user's HTML profile page in the Agora.
    -   **Step 2: Implement a Dynamic Outbox**
        -   Modify the `/u/<user>/outbox` endpoint to serve a collection of the user's recent subnodes.
        -   For each subnode, generate a `Create` activity with a `Note` object.
        -   The `Note` content should be the subnode's Markdown content converted to sanitized HTML.
        -   The `Note` should include a `url` linking back to the original subnode in the Agora.
    -   **Step 3: Handle Follows & Implement Inbox**
        -   Implement logic in the `/u/<user>/inbox` endpoint to handle incoming `Follow` activities.
        -   **Use the existing SQLite database to store follower relationships.** This will require a new `followers` table (e.g., with columns for `user_being_followed` and `follower_actor_url`).
        -   Upon receiving a valid `Follow` request, the server should send an `Accept` activity back to the follower's inbox.
        -   (Future) Evolve from a pull-based outbox to a push-based model where new subnodes are sent to followers' inboxes directly.


# âœ… Completed Work: Refactoring `main.ts`

**Goal:** Improve maintainability of the frontend code by breaking up the monolithic `main.ts` file.
**Date:** 2025-09-28

-   **Summary:**
    -   The `main.ts` file had grown to over 2500 lines, making it difficult to navigate and maintain.
    -   Identified several self-contained features that could be extracted into their own modules.
-   **Actions Taken:**
    -   Created a new `app/js-src/util.ts` for shared utility functions like `safeJsonParse` and constants like `CLIENT_DEFAULTS`.
    -   Extracted all settings and `localStorage` management into `app/js-src/settings.ts`.
    -   Created a reusable `makeDraggable` function in `app/js-src/draggable.ts` and refactored the three draggable UI components (Hypothesis, Agora Meditation, Music Player) to use it.
    -   Moved the "Agora Meditation" / "Demo Mode" feature into `app/js-src/demo.ts`.
    -   Moved the subnode starring feature into `app/js-src/starring.ts`.
    -   Moved the ambient music player feature into `app/js-src/music.ts`.
-   **Outcome:**
    -   Reduced `main.ts` from over 2500 lines to approximately 1700 lines.
    -   Extracted over 650 lines of code into new, feature-specific modules, improving code organization and separation of concerns.
    -   `main.ts` now acts as a high-level orchestrator, initializing the various modules.
