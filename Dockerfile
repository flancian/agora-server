# In development, but this should work. 
#
# Results in a simple agora-server container running repository pulls only. This is meant to be used with docker-compose and [[coop cloud]] (based on docker swarm) to run alongside an [[agora server]] (which runs the UI/renders nodes).

# As of 2023, you probably want to look at the [[coop cloud]] recipe if you are considering running an Agora for your community :) https://anagora.org/agora-recipe for more.
#
# To build (you should be able to replace docker with podman):
#
# $ docker build -t agora-server .
#
# To drop into a debugging shell in the container:
#
# $ docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash agora-server
#
# Aisde: if you are running podman rootless, check that you can write to 'agora' in the container. You may need to:
#
# $ podman unshare chgrp -R 1001 agora  # I only tested this with podman so far.
#
# To then run an Agora Server interactively port 5017 (this assumes $HOME/agora contains an Agora, replace that path with your Agora root):
#
# $ docker run -it -p 5017:5017 -v ${HOME}/agora:/home/agora/agora:Z -u agora agora-server
#
# To run the Agora Server detached (in serving mode): 
#
# $ docker run -dt -p 5017:5017 -v ${HOME}/agora:/home/agora/agora:Z -u agora agora-server
#
# To run the reference Agora Server directly from upstream packages, skipping building:
#
# $ docker run -dt -p 5017:5017 -v ${HOME}/agora:/home/agora/agora:Z -u agora git.coopcloud.tech/flancian/agora-server
#
# Enjoy!
